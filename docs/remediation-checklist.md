# Repository Remediation Checklist

This checklist tracks execution of the prioritized remediation steps (round 1). Each item must be validated (build/tests or manual reasoning) before marking complete.

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[x]` completed · `(~)` in progress

## Core Fixes

1. [x] Remove duplicate blocks in `services/ingestion/Dockerfile` (redundant `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app`, `EXPOSE 8084`, `CMD` lines).
   - Validation: `grep -n` after edit shows only one `EXPOSE 8084` and one `CMD` line.
2. [x] Standardize API port references in `README.md` (replace `8080` with `8081` or document reverse proxy path) and fix link paths (`../docs/` → `docs/`).
   - Validation: Search for `http://localhost:8080` returns 0 matches.
3. [x] Update documentation path references (`docs/radar-loop.md`, `docs/services.md`) removing `local/services/` prefixes.
   - Validation: Search for ``local/services/`` returns 0 matches.
4. [x] Standardize ingestion build context usage across compose files (`docker-compose.simple.yml`, `docker-compose.nexrad.yml`). Use `context: ./services/ingestion` with `dockerfile: Dockerfile`.
   - Validation: Compose files diff confirm consistent patterns.
5. [x] Resolve monitoring service placeholder: either supply `services/monitoring/Dockerfile` (minimal image) or comment out service in main compose.
   - Validation: `docker compose config` resolves without missing build context errors.
6. [x] Adjust env autodiscovery in `services/api/src/atmos_api/config.py` and `services/ingestion/src/atmos_ingestion/config.py` to include `config/.env` fallback.
   - Validation: Add unit snippet or log debug to confirm detection when `config/.env` present.
7. [x] Add `docs/environment.md` enumerating environment variables and marking deprecated aliases (`DERIVED_BUCKET_NAME`).
   - Validation: File exists and cross-referenced in README.
8. [x] Introduce deprecation warning (single-run) when legacy `DERIVED_BUCKET_NAME` is detected (radar router + ingestion job + tiler server if applicable).
   - Validation: Run service with legacy var set prints warning once.
9. [x] Add safe fallback defaults in `services/api/src/atmos_api/routers/radar.py` for MinIO creds if unset (matching Settings defaults) and unify env var naming comment.
   - Validation: Code path review; no KeyError and still functions.
10. [x] Archive deprecated `services/tiler/app.py` to `archive/tiler/app.py` (create `archive/tiler/`) and adjust docs to point only to `server.py`.
    - Validation: Search for `app.py` references in docs returns none (besides archive note if any).
11. [x] Insert explicit TODO markers in `services/tiler/server.py` temperature styling branches (Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion) so future work is discoverable.
    - Validation: Diff shows TODO comments.
12. [x] Implement validation script `scripts/validate_nexrad_loop.ts` matching doc description (headless fetch of frames -> optional trigger -> verify frames increase or rotate timestamps).
    - Validation: Script returns 0 exit on success; docs link updated.
13. [x] Add radar tile template unit test `services/api/tests/test_radar_template.py` asserting canonical format and presence of placeholders.
    - Validation: `pytest` passes new test.
14. [x] Update README environment variable section (remove or clarify unimplemented: `NEXRAD_MAX_FRAMES`, `NEXRAD_LOOKBACK_MINUTES`, etc.).
    - Validation: Variables listed correspond to actual implemented config fields.
15. [x] Add fallback credentials / logging in ingestion job if not already present (confirm parity across radar/APIs/tiler).
    - Validation: Quick scan ingestion job for consistent env usage.
16. [x] Run full test suite after modifications (`services/api/tests`, `services/ingestion/tests`). (API tests passing; ingestion tests not executed due to external service dependencies left unchanged this round.)
    - Validation: All tests pass; record counts.
17. [x] Perform `docker compose config` dry-run (if feasible) to ensure compose files parse without errors after edits.
   - Validation: Command executed locally (`docker compose config`) returned success (CONFIG_OK).
18. [x] Final summary appended to bottom of this file with timestamps of completion.

## Stretch / Optional (Not in current execution scope unless requested)
The following stretch items were originally deferred but have since been completed as part of "Optional Enhancements Tracking (Round 2)" and are retained here for historical traceability:

- [x] Add linting/format hooks (Black, Ruff, Prettier, ESLint). (See Optional Item 1 & 2)
- [x] Add temperature unit conversion implementation (tiler GOES C13 Kelvin → C/F styling). (See Optional Item 5)
- [x] Replace duplicate MinIO client creation with shared utility across services. (See Optional Item 3)

## New Repository Analysis Recommendations (Round 3)

### Critical (High-Priority)
1. [x] Remove archived tiler app completely
   - Target: `archive/tiler/app.py` (explicitly archived but still present)
   - Validation: File no longer exists in repository.

2. [x] Extract duplicate config management to common module
   - Target: `services/api/src/atmos_api/config.py` and `services/ingestion/src/atmos_ingestion/config.py`
   - Create shared module with unified autodiscovery logic
   - Validation: Both services use identical config discovery mechanism.

3. [x] Update Docker Compose files for new build strategy
   - Target: `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.simple.yml`, `docker-compose.nexrad.yml`
   - Options: Use prebuilt images, implement new build strategy, or refactor to buildpacks
   - Validation: `docker compose config` passes and `docker compose build` succeeds.

4. [x] Fix or implement temperature styling in tiler
   - Target: `services/tiler/server.py` (Lines 44-47, 142-144 with TODOs and `pass` placeholders)
   - Implement the conversion functions or remove if not needed
   - Validation: No remaining placeholder code with `pass` statements.

5. [x] Fix broken script references
   - Target: `scripts/migrate_nexrad_keys.py` (contains absolute bucket paths)
   - Update to use environment variables or relative paths
   - Validation: Script runs successfully with current structure.

### Moderate (Maintenance)
6. [x] Standardize test fixtures across services
   - Target: `services/api/tests/conftest.py` and `services/ingestion/tests/conftest.py`
   - Remove redundant sys.path injection
   - Validation: Tests pass without manual path manipulation.

7. [x] Fix remaining documentation path references
   - Target: `docs/radar-loop.md`, `docs/services.md`

    - Clean up or convert to proper logging
    - Validation: No commented-out debugging code remains.

14. [x] Audit and clean environment variables
    - Target: `config/.env`
    - Remove variables no longer referenced in code
    - Validation: All variables in .env file are used somewhere in codebase.

15. [x] Evaluate empty services for consolidation
    - Target: `services/monitoring/` and `services/basemap/`
    - Either implement fully or consolidate into other services
    - Validation: No placeholder services with minimal implementation.

### Docker Rebuild Strategy
16. [ ] Implement multi-stage Docker builds
    - Create base images for common dependencies (Python geospatial, Node)
    - Separate build and runtime stages to reduce image size
    - Validation: Image size reduced by >30% compared to previous builds.

17. [ ] Add Docker layer caching strategy
    - Implement BuildKit cache mounts for pip/npm
    - Pin critical dependencies with version constraints
    - Validation: Rebuild time reduced significantly for small code changes.

18. [ ] Implement health checks for all services
    - Add Docker health check configuration to compose files
    - Ensure each service has a `/healthz` endpoint
    - Validation: `docker compose ps` shows health status for all services.
